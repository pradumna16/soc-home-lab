# Wazuh SIEM Home Lab - Day 3 Documentation

## 🌟 Module Focus: Agent Deployment + Basic Log Monitoring

---

### ✅ Goal:
- Deploy Wazuh agents on **Kali Linux** and **Windows Server 2019**
- Monitor and alert on authentication activity
- Capture brute-force attempts from both sides

---

## 🚀 Agent Installation

### Kali Linux Agent (kali-agent)
- VM added to the **Host-Only** network segment (`VMnet1`) matching Wazuh server's subnet (192.168.52.x)
- Assigned a static IP: `192.168.52.110`

#### Steps:
```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/linux/wazuh-agent_4.11.2-1_amd64.deb
sudo WAZUH_MANAGER='192.168.52.128' WAZUH_AGENT_NAME='kali-agent' dpkg -i ./wazuh-agent_4.11.2-1_amd64.deb
sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
```

- Log forwarding confirmed from `/var/log/auth.log`, Apache access/error logs, and other critical paths.
- Tested with SSH brute force (via Hydra)
- Sample rule hit:
```json
rule.id: 2502
rule.description: syslog: User missed the password more than one time
rule.level: 10
rule.groups: [syslog, authentication_failed, brute_force]
```

---

### Windows Server Agent (win-agent)
- VM also moved to **Host-Only** segment
- Assigned static IP: `192.168.52.120`

#### Steps (PowerShell):
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.11.2-1.msi -OutFile $env:TEMP\wazuh-agent.msi
msiexec.exe /i $env:TEMP\wazuh-agent.msi /q WAZUH_MANAGER='192.168.52.128' WAZUH_AGENT_NAME='win-agent'
```

- Verified log reception on Wazuh Dashboard.
- Added custom `<localfile>` entries for `Security`, `System`, and `Sysmon` logs.
- Successfully parsed RDP brute force attempts (Event ID `4625` with `logonType: 3`)

#### Sample Rule Hit:
```json
rule.id: 18107
rule.description: Windows logon failed.
rule.level: 5
rule.groups: [windows, authentication_failed, win_logon_failed]
```

## 🧬 Issues Encountered & Resolved

| Issue | Root Cause | Resolution |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Apache access.log not decoding | Missing or misconfigured decoder | Will revisit in Module 5: Custom Log Ingestion |
| Sysmon logs not visible | Logging not enabled or ACLs misconfigured | Enabled via `wevtutil` and adjusted permissions |
| Wazuh Manager crash after rule edit | Invalid XML (`url` field static + malformed tag) | Fixed syntax + restarted manager |
| Agent config not applied | Wrong `agent.conf` path | Used `/var/ossec/etc/shared/default/agent.conf` to push config |

---

## 🔍 Success Markers:
- ✔️ Log flow from both agents
- ✔️ Custom agent names recognized on Dashboard
- ✔️ SSH brute force from Kali detected
- ✔️ RDP brute force attempts on Windows captured
- ✔️ Sysmon started sending event logs (e.g., `EventID 1`, `3`, etc.)

---

## 📊 Next Steps (Day 4 Preview)
### Module 2: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Enable FIM on both agents
- Track sensitive files & registry
- Generate alerts on changes
