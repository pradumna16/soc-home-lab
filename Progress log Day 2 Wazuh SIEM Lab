# 📘 Wazuh SIEM Lab - Progress Day 2: All-in-One Installation Success

## 🛠️ Objective
To set up Wazuh (SIEM) in a home lab environment using a simplified method after multiple installation failures. This documentation covers how the all-in-one installation script was used to successfully install and run Wazuh, and how access was gained from a remote Windows host machine.

---

## 🧱 Lab Environment
- **Host Machine:** Windows (for dashboard access)
- **Ubuntu Server (VM):** Static IP `192.168.52.128`
- **Role:** Acts as Wazuh Server (Indexer + Manager + Dashboard)

---

## ⚠️ Initial Failures
### Issues Faced:
1. **Dashboard Already Installed:**
   - Previous partial installs caused conflicts.
   - Overwrite option failed due to inability to fully remove Wazuh dashboard files.

2. **Package Purge Failed:**
   - Commands like `sudo apt purge wazuh-manager wazuh-dashboard wazuh-indexer wazuh-agent` didn't work.
   - Resulted in `Unable to locate package` errors.

3. **Manual Installation Frustrations:**
   - Cert generation, file paths, and service issues slowed progress.
   - Dashboard login failed due to unknown credentials.

4. **No `internal_users.yml` File:**
   - Couldn’t locate user password config normally found at `/var/ossec/data/wazuh-dashboard/internal_users.yml`

   ```
   - ⚙️ Installs: Wazuh Indexer, Manager, Dashboard, Filebeat

## 🔐 Resetting the Admin Password
If the default dashboard credentials don’t work:

1. **Download Password Tool:**
   ```bash
   curl -so wazuh-passwords-tool.sh https://packages.wazuh.com/resources/wazuh-passwords-tool.sh
   ```

2. **Make Script Executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x wazuh-passwords-tool.sh
   ```

3. **Reset Password:**
   ```bash
   sudo bash wazuh-passwords-tool.sh -u admin -p 'YourNewPassword123!'
   ```

4. **Login:** Use `admin` and your new password at the Wazuh dashboard login screen.
