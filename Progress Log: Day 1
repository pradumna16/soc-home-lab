🏠 Home Lab Project: Building a SIEM with Wazuh, pfSense, and OpenSearch
========================================================================

✈️ Project Title
----------------

**"Home Cybersecurity Lab: From Infrastructure to Insight with pfSense and Wazuh"**
result from todays progress


📝 Project Goal
---------------

To build a fully functional home lab environment using virtualization (VMware Workstation) to simulate a small-scale corporate network with:

-   A central **Wazuh SIEM Server** (running on Ubuntu Server VM)

-   **pfSense** as the router/firewall

-   Multiple monitored endpoints (Windows Server, Kali Linux)

-   **OpenSearch** integrated with Wazuh for dashboarding

-   Windows physical host for GUI-based monitoring and alerting

This environment is meant for testing, monitoring, and gaining hands-on experience in security operations, network segmentation, alert management, and real-time log analysis.

📅 Progress Log: Day 1 --- "Network Foundations with pfSense"
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 🎯 Goal of the Day

Set up pfSense inside VMware and configure networking so that:

-   All virtual machines are behind pfSense

-   pfSense provides routing and DHCP

-   Ubuntu Server connects successfully to pfSense LAN

-   Windows host can communicate with internal network

* * * * *

### ⚙️ Tasks Completed

-   Installed pfSense in VMware with two NICs:

    -   `em0` (WAN): Bridged to host's physical internet

    -   `em1` (LAN): Host-only network (VMnet1)

-   Configured **LAN interface** IP: `192.168.52.1/24`

-   Enabled **DHCP server** on LAN inside pfSense

-   Attached Ubuntu Server VM to VMnet1 (host-only)

-   Verified successful IP allocation (e.g. `192.168.52.128`)

-   Successfully pinged pfSense from Ubuntu: `ping 192.168.52.1`

-   Enabled static IP plans for critical infrastructure (e.g., Wazuh server)

#### ✅ Commands Used

```
# Ubuntu VM
ping 192.168.52.1
ip a   # To check assigned IP
sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml  # To set static IP
sudo netplan apply

# pfSense Console (if needed)
set interface ip 192.168.52.1/24  # During LAN setup

# Windows Host
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
ping 192.168.52.1

```

### ⚡ Challenges & Solutions

#### ❌ Issue:

**"Windows host can't reach pfSense or Ubuntu server"**

**Root Cause:**

-   VMnet1 (host-only) was not properly configured with an IP

-   DHCP not set up yet, so no IP was assigned to host's VMnet1

**Solution:**

-   Manually assigned a static IP to `VMnet1` adapter on Windows host:

    -   IP: `192.168.52.100`

    -   Subnet: `255.255.255.0`

-   Verified with `ipconfig` and `ping 192.168.52.1`

-   Network communication between host and VMs worked!

#### ❌ Issue:

**"Bridged network not getting internet"**

**Root Cause:** VMware Bridge Protocol wasn't checked on the correct interface.

**Solution:**

-   Opened Network Adapter settings > Checked VMware Bridge Protocol

-   Restored default network settings in VMware Virtual Network Editor

-   Verified bridged interface connected to active physical NIC

* * * * *

### 🔗 Results

-   Internal network between pfSense LAN and Ubuntu Server = SUCCESSFUL

-   Windows host can communicate with internal network

-   pfSense dashboard reachable from host (via 192.168.52.1)

-   Foundation laid for SIEM components

* * * * *

🚀 Next Steps (Day 2 Plan)
--------------------------

-   Assign static IP to Ubuntu Server for Wazuh installation

-   Start Wazuh server setup

-   Connect Wazuh agents from Windows Server and Kali Linux

-   Configure rules, logs, and test alerting pipeline

-   Begin OpenSearch integration with Wazuh

Stay tuned for **Progress Log: Day 2 - Wazuh Server Deployment** ✨
